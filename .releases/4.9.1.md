**Bug Fixes**

* Adjusted the `Scheduler.scheduler` function to address a bug introduced into Node.js between versions 10 and 12. In short, after calling the `setTimeout` function, the `clearTimeout` function must be invoked â€” even if the timer has elapsed normally, and the associated callback was executed. Failing to do so, can prevent memory associated with the callback (via closure) from being garbage collected.

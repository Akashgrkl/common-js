**Technical Enhancements**

* Updated the [`moment`](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/-project-status/) and [`moment-timezone`](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/-project-status/) libraries. That said, these libraries are deprecated and should be removed from the project.
* Updated [`Jasmine`](https://jasmine.github.io/index.html) framework to the next major version (v4). 
* Removed the [`gulp-jasmine`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-jasmine) dependency. Jasmine tests no longer in Gulp.
